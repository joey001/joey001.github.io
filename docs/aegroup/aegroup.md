# The Algorithm Engineering Group in UESTC
I run the **Algorithm Engineering Group** in the Algorithms and Logic Lab.

[**Algorithm Engineering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm_engineering), by wikipedia, is subject focusing on the design, analysis, implementation, optimization, profiling and experimental evaluation of computer algorithms, bridging the gap between algorithm theory and practical applications of algorithms. 

We currently work on some interesting combinatorial optimization problems, including graph problems, industrial cutting (or packing) problems and scheduling problems.
We develop both exact and heuristics algorithms, integer linear programs, and even parallel methods. 
We investigate both their empirical and theoretical performances.

For example, we have built some high-performance programs for solving:  

1. relaxed clique problems. 
2. steiner tree problems. 
3. 2- and 3-dimensional cutting-stock problems. 
4. satellite scheduling problems.

<font color=red>**NOTICE**</font>: we recruite **undergraduates** all the year round.
If you are interested in joining us, drop me a mail.

### Suggestions for future students
- Undergraduates: UESTC undergraduates can come to my office or send me a mail all the year round. You should note that the research training is more or less a warm-up towards the Master or Phd stduy. 
- Master: If you conside me as a supervisor of your Master study, here are some tips. 
    1. Make sure that you like writing and optimizing C/C++ codes. (Most of time, we use C/C++ for performance.) 
    2. Make sure that you can cope with traditional algorithm design. <!-- We do NOT often study deep learning algorithms. -->
    3. Send me a mail as early as possible. 
 <!-- I feel sorry for not replying every application letter in the peaking time. Please try to highlight your advantages of doing the research.  -->
- Foreign students: If you are interested in joining us, please highlight your advantages in doing the algorihmic research in your application letter. Having some studying or working experiences in China will be an advantage.
