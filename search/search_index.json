I am Yi Zhou, an associate professor in the computer science department of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) , Chengdu, P.R. China. I am also a member of the Algorithms and Logic Lab in UESTC. I obtained the PhD degree of Computer Science from the Universite Angers, France in 2017. My PhD supervisor is Prof. Jin-Kao Hao , a senior IUF member . I got MS and BS degrees of Computer Science from UESTC in 2010 and 2013, respectively. Contact: zhou.yi[at]uestc[dot]edu[dot]cn Research I am interested in the design and analysis of practical algorithms, i.e., algorithms that work well in practice. In a more broad perspective, I study Algorithm Engineering . My recent work mainly focus on fast algorithms for some hard graph problems. You can refer to my Publication or DBLP pages for more information. Courses I am a member of the algorithm teaching groups in the CS departement of UESTC. Here is a list a courses that I have given. 2022.03-2022.02 The Design and Analysis of Algorithms, for graduate students in CS department (Yibin Campus). 2021.09-2021.11 Optimization Algorithms, for students in CS department. 2020.09-2020.11 Optimization Algorithms, for students in CS department. 2019.09-2020.11 Optimization Algorithm, for students in CS department. 2018.12, 2019.11 Selected Topics of Big Data, for students in Institution of Inovation and Entrepreneurship, UESTC. 2018.09 Optimization Algorithm.

By Wiki, Algorithm Engineering focus on the design, analysis, implementation, optimization, profiling and experimental evaluation of computer algorithms, bridging the gap between algorithm theory and practical applications of algorithms in software engineering. We currently work on some well-known hard combinatorial optimization problems. We develop heuristics combinatorial search, integer linear programs, parallel methods etc., and investigate both their empirical and theoretical performances.
